    <p class="intro"><strong>Knotting Developments</strong> was formed when Michael Dinerman’s  entrepreneurial spirit brought him to Athens to focus on an adaptive reuse project for the town after seeing the Beltline effect in Atlanta. Jennifer Davidson and Michael attended High School together and have an affinity for the culture and community in Athens. They work from the premise that Athens’ independent, creative community needs a central place to live, work and play. We look to foster a sense of community at General Time and surrounding neighborhoods.</p>

<p class="intro">The General Time Athens development is a brownfield adaptive re-use project combining site and building that provides a trailhead and park, an outdoor amphitheater and indoor music venue, artist studios, galleries, event space, restaurants, cafes, local business (tech, incubator, maker-space, craft, music & arts), retail, and a live/work residential community.</p>

The General Time site has unique potential to become a social and commercial hub within the growing energy north of Downtown Athens. It is positioned along a favorite cycling route and connects Chase and Barber streets through the site, to the railroad corridor and the west edge of Sandy Creek Nature Center. This site potentially expands the proposed 2014 ACC Greenway Network and allows for an internal loop and trailhead.

ATHENS, GA. â€” Knotting Development, in partnership with the Ardent Cos., has broken ground on General Time Athens, an adaptive reuse project at the former Westclox Building in Athens. The first phase of the project will revitalize the 100,000-square-foot warehouse of the former clock manufacturer, located at 100 Newton Bridge Road, roughly two miles from the University of Georgia (UGA) campus. Terrapin Beer Co. will anchor the project, leasing 68,000 square feet of warehouse space. The Athens-based brewery has been situated across the street from the site for 11 years. Phase II of General Time Athens will include environmental remediation, as well as demolishing and rebuilding the original 250,000-square-foot Westclox manufacturing building. The space will house offices, shops and restaurants. In addition, the project will house residential units and a 3,000-seat music venue that will host beer and wine festivals, recreational events, movie nights and other community events. Charlottesville, Va.-based Red Light Management is developing the music venue in partnership with Knotting and Ardent. Headed by UGA graduate Michael Dinerman and Jennifer Davidson, Knotting Development worked closely with the Athens Clarke County (ACC) Commissioners, ACC Economic Development, ACC Leisure Services, small business owners and the surrounding community to curate the vision for the project. General Time Athens is slated for completion in spring 2020.
